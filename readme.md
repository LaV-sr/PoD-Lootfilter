# LaV's Path of Diablo Lootfilter

This is the Lootfilter I am using in the Diablo II modification "[Path of Diablo](https://pathofdiablo.com/)"
You can see the lootfilter in action when I am playing PoD on my [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/LaVsr) - That will only be the case after resets though.

## About the Lootfilter

My lootfilter is loosely based on a couple of [existing lootfilters](https://pathofdiablo.com/wiki/index.php?title=List_of_Loot_Filters), but I have made some significant changes to them.
For example I could not stand the way they display the name of unidentified set and unique items when they drop and how some straight up hide bad uniques.
Also some of the excessive crafting material highlighting was annoying to me so I got rid of it.
Generally I am showing more stuff while still filtering out most of the trash with less obnoxious highlighting. 

## Installation

You can install the Lootfilter by downloading the item.filter-file and saving it to your <Diablo II Install Path>/Path of Dialo/ directory. 
You might have to overwrite your existing item.filter file.

## Notepad++ Syntax Highlighing

If you want to edit the filter I highly recommend using KarmaNation256's [Notepad++ syntax highlighting](https://github.com/KarmaNation256/pod-loot-filter/wiki/Installing-Syntax-Highlights)
It makes prolonged work on the lootfilter way more managable than staring at plain text.
